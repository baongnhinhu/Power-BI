# Market-Analysis-Report-for-National-Clothing-Chain
## Project Description:
An online national clothing chain needs help on creating a targeted marketing campaign. 

Sales have been flat and they want to lure lost customers back. They want to advertise specific products to specific customers in specific locations, 
but they donâ€™t know who to target. They have three products in mind:
- Shirt: $25
- Sweater: $100
- Leather Bag: $1,000
They need us to conduct an analysis to determine the best product to advertise to each customer.
