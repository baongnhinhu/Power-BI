# Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI


## Introduction
Welcome to my repository! This is the central hub for projects affiliated with Udacity's Data Analysis and Visualization with Microsoft Power BI Nanodegree Program. This project help me equip individuals with the essential skills required to excel in the role of a data analyst. These skills encompass various aspects such as data pre-processing, data visualization, and data analysis, all achieved through the utilization of Microsoft Power BI as our primary tool.

Within this repository, you'll find a collection of projects, each tailored to further your proficiency in data analysis. To ensure that you get the most out of these projects, we've included a detailed README file with each one.<br>

I encourage you to explore the projects and their corresponding README files, as they provide valuable information and resources to support your learning journey.<br>

I hope you find these projects engaging and educational. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.<br>

Happy analyzing! ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰
## Project Documentation

**1. Introduction to Preparing and Modeling Data:**<br>
This course is a crucial step in Power BI for anyone who needs to mash together multiple data sources, clean them, restructure them, and harmonize them into a single and efficient data model to support reporting. Weâ€™ll cover Power BIâ€™s built-in Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) tool, Power Query, learn foundational data modeling principles, cover some introductory DAX (Data Analytics Expressions), and touch on troubleshooting and optimization. 

**2. Creating Visualizations with Power BI**<br>
In this course, students will learn how to carry Power BI beyond mere bar charts and transform their reports into data exploration & storytelling tools that companies can use to better understand their data.

**3. Advanced Data Analysis**<br>
Using Power BI, the overarching goal of the course is to help students become effective at the process of retrieving, analyzing, and visualizing data in order to answer questions and draw conclusions. After learning about descriptive and inferential statistics, histograms, linear regression, and the concepts of correlation and probability, the course moves into M, the language of Power Query to build custom formulas as part of the data transformation process.  Students then learn the language of DAX to analyze data. The final lesson of the course goes through a number of visualizations in Power BI and explores how those visuals may be used, edited, or enhanced to effectively relay information to an audience.
